# Draw-It-or-Lose-It
•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room company already has a game application named Draw It or Lose It which runs only on Android platform. In the game, computer renders the image from stock drawings at a steady rate and fully complete in thirty seconds. The game consists of has four rounds with each round lasting for one minute. So, if a team does not answer the puzzle, remaining team will get the turn and has fifteen seconds to guess. The client plans to expand the web-based game to multiple platforms like Linux, Mac and Windows including mobile devices and therefore has requested to do the evaluation of the characteristics, pros and cons of each of the platforms to help with the decision making on benefits of each platform. 
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Client’s all requirements have been included in the design. Similarly, development requirements have been carefully analyzed to give best recommendations to the client.
•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document was helpful in designing the code for the game. With the document, I get a bird’s eye view of the complete game and the resources. 
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise the part of the work, it would be the evaluation part. More in-depth research of each platform would make the decision making even more better for the client.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I divided user’s need into various subcategories under the software design template so that every requirement is included and met in the software. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because without including the user’s requirement the software is not complete  which can be very unprofessional and frustrating for clients.
